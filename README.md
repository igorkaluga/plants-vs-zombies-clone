#Plants VS Zombies Clone.

This is the third project in the 61a class. Focused on object-oriented programming, mutable local state, classes, inheritance, and method resolutions.

There are various ant and bee classes. Each ant can be places along three lanes. Bees spawn and their goal is to reach the end of their lane, which would signal game over.
